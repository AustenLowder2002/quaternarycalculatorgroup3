# quaternary-calc-3  
Please use Gradle to build and run the program.


### Team:  
* GUI = Hannah Johnston and Caige Rogers
* Calculator = Samuel Gross
* Converter + Tests = Austen Lowder
* Code Clean-up, Meeting Notes + README = Leah Casey

### About this Project:
This application looks like a regular calculator, but only has buttons for the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. The user can enter a quaternary (base-4) number, choose an operation button (addition, subtraction, division, or multiplication), enter a second quaternary number, and see the result of the operation. The user can also enter just one quaternary number and then choose a button to see its square or square root. Finally, the user can toggle between displaying a quaternary number or its decimal equivalent.
